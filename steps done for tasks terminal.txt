Terminal Approach where possible

Assignment 1: 
 1. Create a new repository, clone it to your local machine

Interpretation of question:
Request is to create remote repo (not local first)

Steps performed:
	a)Use website github.com to create repo, repository name and description given
	
	create folder “term”
 	open terminal 
	cd /users/Heathglover/Desktop/term
	git clone https://github.com/heathg/Assignment1-GAMELB-Term.git
		

	
 2. Open Xcode, create a new Project, then and add the project files to this repository.

Steps performed:
	a)Open Xcode
	b)Create new project, save in the same folder as the .git folder 
           (/users/Heathglover/Desktop/term/Assignment1-GAMELB-Term) folder

 3. Then add the following text file to the repository answering the questions within.

Steps performed:
clicked on text file link in slack and saved locally to the repo folder then answered 
questions

 4. Commit and push files to the repository.
Steps performed:
in terminal
cd /Assignment1-GAMELB-Term
git add —a 
git commit -m “commit related text went here ” 
git push https://github.com/heathg/Assignment1-GAMELB-Term.git


*Validation step (not requested but wanted to do)
then further verification by going into the repo on the GitHub.com website to see the
Xcode files and text file was available.

Not 100% confident on the commands used are correct!

I done the task once after a number of trip ups and completed the tasks requested, I had
no issues doing the assignment but felt I still had no comprehension of what actually 
happened or how i got there, I decided to also do the task again noting down the steps
for both a GUI (lazy/efficient at times approach) and also a more terminal approach
