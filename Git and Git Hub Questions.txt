Git and Git Hub Questions:
--------------------------

1. What is the equivalent git command for when you press the Git Hub app "Sync" button?

git pull 

2. What is the command for seeing the repository history via the command line?

git log

3. In the Git Hub app, I can "discard changes" to a file by right clicking on it. What's the equivalent command on the terminal?

run git status to check directory status to confirm file modification not staged then git checkout

4. What does a "pull request" actually do?

git pull completes git fetch and git merge commands into one command ultimately doing a sync.

5. What does a .gitignore file do? 

stops git checking in specified files and or directories to github

6. Why is a .gitignore file useful?

git ignore is useful to not publish files or folders that are not relevant to anyone else or not required to be uploaded to the remote repo

7. What is "Open Source" software?

Open Source software is software where the source code is freely available for use or modification as users or developers require. “Human Knowledge belongs to the world” 

8. How can "Open Source" software help me with my final project?

Using open source software can be useful so instead of re-writing or building something from scratch that already exists, using a source such as git hub can locate software that already performs a certain function. 

Even if the absolute function is not 100% to which is required finding base level software which can then be modified or adapted to suit the project is viable. This will in turn significantly reduce the time to complete the final project.
