Not 100% confident on the commands used are correct!

I done the task once after a number of trip ups and completed the tasks requested, I had
no issues doing the assignment but felt I still had no comprehension of what actually 
happened or how i got there, I decided to also do the task again noting down the steps
for both a GUI (lazy/efficient at times approach) and also a more terminal approach.

After creating multiple repos and going through the task multiple times found comprehending what goes on alot easier.
